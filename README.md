## Purpose

Dopagotchi is a tool that helps users who struggle with dopamine regulation. It can help you categorize activities and decide which form of reward you want in the moment. For example, you can feed your pet a starter (a quick activity such as taking a walk or drinking water) or a side (an activity that can be done with something else such as listening to music).
Eventually, your pet will become hungry, motivating you to take part in some dopamine activities to keep your pet (and yourself) happy.

## Features

- Users can add activities to each food category to feed their pet (and watch it sparkle!).
- Users can specify a goal for how many activities to complete each day. This determines how often the health decreases.
- Users can customize their Dopagotchi experience with custom colours and pet names

## Future Features
- Users can receive notifications when their pet's health is low, reminding them to complete a dopamine activity
- Users can customize pet health settings. For example, your pet's health decreases when you open TikTok, or when your screen time exceeds 5 hours.
- Users can choose different types of pets!
- Users can add Shortcuts to feed their pet using Siri
- Users can add a Widget to their home screen to easily feed their pet with their favourite activities
- Users can receive suggestions for which activity to take part in based on previous patterns

## Usage

To start, add activities to a food category. These activities can be repeated as many times as desired without having to re-add them. Once you have completed an activity, tap the Feed button to feed your pet. Don't forget to check out the settings for pet customizations!
